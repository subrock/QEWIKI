<b>How To Make Perfect Hard Boiled Eggs</b>

Cutting to the chase, it’s a combination of how you cook the eggs, how you cool them, and how you crack the shell afterwards. The first mistake most people make is starting with cold water to boil eggs. The key is to have a hot boiling start, time it correctly, then shock the eggs in an ice water bath. I describe this in more detail in my how to boil eggs post, but here’s the process. A pot of hot water on the stove and an ice water bath.

<b>Prep the Hot and Cold Water</b>

Bring a medium sized pot of water to a boil. Make sure there’s enough water to cover the eggs by about an inch. And while you’re waiting for it to boil, remove the eggs from the fridge (set them on the counter) and prep an ice water bath in a large bowl. Place eggs into a pot of hot water.

<b>Cook the Eggs Until They’re Hard Boiled</b>

Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low and use a skimmer to gently and slowly add the eggs into the water. Then, turn the heat back up to a boil. Set a timer and cook the eggs for 12 to 14 minutes. See my egg timer chart. Hard boiled eggs in an ice water bath.

<b>Put the Eggs in the Ice Water Bath</b>

Once the eggs have cooked to your preferred time, use the skimmer to remove the eggs and immediately submerge them in the ice water bath to stop them from cooking. You’ll let the eggs sit here for about 5 to 10 minutes before peeling. Slicing hard boiled eggs in half.

<b>Tap, Roll, Then Peel the Eggs</b>

To peel hard boiled eggs the easiest way possible, make sure to tap, roll, then peel. First, tap the egg on the bottom. Then, gently roll the egg on your countertop with the palm of your hand. Cracks will start to form and loosen the outer shell. Start peeling from the bottom first (always), as there’s a little air pocket and you’ll be able to get under the membrane. The shell should come off easily from there! Hard boiled eggs on the counter.
